This plugin uses jQuery to open external links in new windows without adding "target=_BLANK" and creating invalid markup.

Adds class 'external' to external text links. Adding rel="external" is optional in case you want to use the rel tag more semantically.

Lots of options.

You can specify the parent items (via CSS selectors) for items opening in a new window and items being styled separately. This allows you to target links in your content without effecting links in your template.
